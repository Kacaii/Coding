## Variables
Today we learned how to create javascript `variables`.

We used to declare variables by using the `var` keyword.

```Javascript

var rotulo = "Ayres"

```

But **ES6(2015)** added block scoped variables with `let` and `const`

```Javascript

let rotuloNome = "Ayres" // Can be ressigned
const  rotuloNumero = "1234" // Can't be reassigned

```

> [!CAUTION]
> `var` can only declare variables in Global Scope and Funcion Scope.
